= DataType-FU {<img src="https://travis-ci.org/nuxy/DataType-FU.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status" />}[https://travis-ci.org/nuxy/DataType-FU]

One of the most annoying things I find about the JavaScript language is the lack of support for strict typing when declaring function variable arguments.  Because of this Iâ€™m forced to litter my code with conditions that contain +typeof+ and +instanceof+ to type check each argument.

This is my attempt to resolve this madness.

== Installation

This package can be easily installed using:

{Bower}[http://bower.io]

    $ bower install datatype-fu

{NPM}[https://www.npmjs.org]

    $ npm install datatype-fu

== Use Example

    var fu = require('datatype-fu').fu;   // Node usage

    var doSomething = fu(
        ['Array', 'Number', 'Object', 'String', '*'],
        function(arr, num, obj, str, any) {

            // do something with the values
        }
    );

    doSomething(
        ['bucket1', 'bucket2', 'bucket3'],
        1234567890,
        { key: 'value' },
        'Hello World',
        undefined
    );

== Performance

General test cases have been created on {jsPerf}[http://jsperf.com/datatype-fu] to measure fu'd operations across supported web browsers.
